    Get the current location along the track

    This function can either compute it whenever it's called (assuming it's fast),
    or return a memoized version. For example, if the GPS module happens to return
    its position at a fixed rate, start a new thread that continuously polls it and
    then updates a global variable. Then, this function just returns that global
    variable.
